					Gustavo's Shitty Tower Defense V 0.1

EDIT FROM THE FUTURE: This was made a long time ago and looking back the code is quite shit (which made this title quite apt). I had this in a private repository, but I figured I'd make it public cause why not. My code has slightly improved since this attempt at a tower defense game. 

README

	1) What is it?

	It's currently just a map editor that makes maps and then a map loader which can spawn some enemies
	and towers. 

	2) What is the plan?

	This will a tower defense game developed by yours truly. The goal is to have a basic campaign, some 
	basic graphics, and a variety of enemies and towers to choose from. Perhaps even a storyline. 

	3) How does it work?

	Tkinter is used to draw the objects and the rest is pretty much done with the standard python
	libraries. I'm a pretty abysmal coder and this is the first thing I've ever decided to really
	try and make into a polished project.

	4) How do I develop this?

	Well, I just update the code either on my desktop or laptop and then upload it to github. Whatever's
	on github is the current version

MILESTONES

	V 0.1 (Current) - Has a map editor, can load up maps and spawn enemies

	V 0.2 (Goal) - Include a gold system to buy towers, add "missions" which spawn certain number of
	enemies at certain points
